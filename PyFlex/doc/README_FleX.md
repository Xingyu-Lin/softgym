NVIDIA Flex - 1.2.0
===================

Flex is a particle-based simulation library designed for real-time applications.
Please see the programmer's manual included in this release package for more information on
the solver API and usage.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

* Windows 32/64 bit (CUDA, DX11, DX12)
* Linux 64 bit (CUDA, tested with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Mint 17.2 Rafaela)

Requirements
------------

A D3D11 capable graphics card with the following driver versions:

* NVIDIA GeForce Game Ready Driver 372.90 or above
* AMD Radeon Software Version 16.9.1 or above
* IntelÂ® Graphics Version 15.33.43.4425 or above

To build the demo at least one of the following is required:

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
* g++ 4.6.3 or higher

And either: 

* CUDA 9.1.85 toolkit
* DirectX 11/12 SDK

Demo 
====

Use the `run_cuda.bat` or `run_d3d.bat` files to launch the demo.

Notes 
-----

* Some scenes also have fluid emitters that can be started using 'space'
* For running the Linux binaries you will need to export the path to where the CUDA run time libraries are
  For example, you may add to your .bashrc file the following:
       
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64


Command Line Options
--------------------

The following commands may be passed to the demo application to modify behavior:

    -fullscreen=wxh  Start fullscreen e.g.: -fullscreen=1280x720
    -msaa=0          Disable multisampling (default is on)
    -device=n        Choose GPU to run on
    -d3d12           Enable D3D12 compute
    -benchmark       Enable bencmark mode, will write a benchmark.txt to the root folder
    -vsync=0         Disable vsync
