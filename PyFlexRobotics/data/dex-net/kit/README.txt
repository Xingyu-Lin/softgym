# KIT Object Mesh Models Processed by the Dexterity Network (Dex-Net)

# OVERVIEW
This folder contains 129 3D mesh models in .OBJ format.
Each mesh is a laser scan from the KIT Object Database.
The meshes are rescaled and transformed from the original versions for integration in the Dex-Net codebase.
If you use these meshes in a publication, we suggest you cite:
